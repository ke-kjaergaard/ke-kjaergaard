# Welcome to my write-ups
I got the idea of making write-ups recently to show to potential employers and colleagues how I hone my skills in my spare time.
When I got the idea, I was doing Natas-18 and figured to just start there.

This leaves a hole from 0 up, which I am gradually filling out by doing the tasks again and writing down the method.


If you want to do the challenges yourself, take a look at the site:
