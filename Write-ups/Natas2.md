# This is a write-up for Natas - level 2

I am greeted with "There is nothing on this page."
My first instinct is to inspect the page and look through the html code.

In here, I find an image of size 1x1 right next the the text on the page.

The source of the image is "files/pixel.png". Aha! Maybe there are other files in the "files" folder.
Let's go to that folder by typing http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/ in the url bar.

On that page is a file overview with pixel.png and a text file. In the text file is info about some users we don't care about as well as the password for the next level!
