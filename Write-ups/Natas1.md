As the text suggests, the password has again been stored in a comment in the html code.

However, right-clicking the page has been disabled.

To get through that hurdle, I right-click on another page, and next to inspect it says (Q), making me think that q, or perhaps ctrl+q is the shortcut.
It turns out not to be, so I turn to my best friend - the google search!

It reveals that ctrl+shift+i (cmd+option+i on macOS) is a shortcut for inspect on firefox, so I do that.

I get an interactive menu with a lot of minimized content. I can open the content by simply clicking it.
As with the last level, the comment is in <div id="content">, and we are done.


Tip: For large websites with a lot of content, the inspect menu can be a little daunting. 
Fear not! You can learn a lot by clicking things and reading the tooltips.
