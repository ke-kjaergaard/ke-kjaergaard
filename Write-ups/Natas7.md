# This is a write-up for Natas - level 7

We are greeted with a home and an About link.

Instinctively as curious internet apes, we press both of them and find nothing.
As curious hacker apes, our next instinct should be to inspect the page.

In doing so, we find a nice hint about where the next password is.
As with the last hint, we encounter "folder structure notation" - but how do we access the folder?
Following the pattern from last level, the answer should be 'http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/etc/natas_webpass/natas8'.
Maybe you even tried that a few times and came here in frustration.

To get the answer, you should look closer at the url on the home or about page.
It says index.php?page=about (or home).

We want to go to a different page, though. How might we get there?

And that's the last hint you're getting ;)
