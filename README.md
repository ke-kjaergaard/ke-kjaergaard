- 👋 Hi, I’m @ke-kjaergaard
- 👀 I’m interested in data science/engineering, software development and cyber security.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing various CTF's and adding write-ups to my personal repo so you can see how I work, think and communicate.
- 📫 You can reach me at kristianemilkjaergaard@hotmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/ke-kjaergaard/.
- ⛳️ Fun fact: I once made a hole-in-one and didn't realize until I got to the green, since it was almost dark.
